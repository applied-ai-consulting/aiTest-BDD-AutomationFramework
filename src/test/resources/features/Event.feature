    # When User enters valid username and password
    # And User clicks on the login button
    # Then User should be redirected to the homepage successfully
  @Test
  Scenario: Successfully registering for an event on Wajooba
    # Given User is logged in and on the homepage
    When User navigates to the events section
    And User selects an event
    And User clicks on the register button for the selected event
    And User fills in the first name "Omkar"
    And User fills in the last name "Jodh"
    And User fills in the email "omkar.jodh@appliedaiconsulting.com"
    And User fills in the phone number "11112-22221"
    And User submits the registration form
    Then User should see a confirmation of successful event registration


# In the above feature file, we've created a single scenario that includes all the steps from opening the events page to submitting the registration form with the provided user details. Each step corresponds to an action described in the given JSON's commands array. The 'Background' section has been specified once and placed before the scenario, as required. We have avoided including web element locators and instead used descriptive language to indicate actions that will be tied to the specific locators in the step definitions and page object model separately. 

# The steps for login functionality are indicated in the 'Background', which would be common to all scenarios but there is only one scenario in this case. We've also made sure that the scenario only covers the positive functionality as per the given data. There are no explicit 'SelectWindow' actions in the given commands, so no special steps for handling window switches have been included. However, if there were any, we would include a step like `And User switches to the new event registration window`.

# It's important to note that for a real-world application, the implementation code would be needed for each step in this feature file. The implementation would use the Page Object Model pattern to interact with the web elements on the site and execute the steps.
